==== Using Translation Helps ====

  - Once the source text is setup on translationStudio (for help see [[en:ta:vol1:process:setup_tsandroid]]), then you are ready to start translating. 
    * It is strongly recommended that you consult the translationNotes and translationWords while doing your translation
  - For the best way to use translationNotes in translationStudio, please read [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_resources]]

==== Editing a page ====

  * To learn how to create or edit a page see [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_create]]
  * If your language has letters that do not appear on your device's keyboard, you may need to install and use translationKeyboard. See [[en:ta:vol1:tech:tk_intro]] and https://unfoldingword.org/translationkeyboard/ .

==== After Translating on translationStudio ====

  - We strongly recommend that your translation be checked. See [[en:ta:vol1:process:prechecking_training]].
  - Once the checking is complete (to any level), you may upload your work. See [[en:ta:vol1:tech:ts_upload]]
  - Once uploaded, you will need to merge your work into Door43. See [[en:ta:vol1:process:upload_merge]]
