====== bread ======


===== Definition: =====

Bread is a food made from flour mixed with water and oil. It is usually made with something that makes it rise, such as yeast. It is then shaped into a loaf and baked.

  * Bread can also be made without something to make it rise. This is "unleavened bread."
  * Since bread was the main food in biblical times, this term was often used to refer to food in general, as in the phrase, "daily bread." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche|Synecdoche]])
  * The "bread of the presence" was a special kind of bread that was made specifically as a sacrifice to God in the tabernacle or temple.

*See [[yeast]], [[tabernacle]], [[temple]],
